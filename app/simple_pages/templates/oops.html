    <h1>Object Oriented Programming with Python</h1>
    <p>
        In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in
        programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in
        the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a
        single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
    </p>

    <h4>Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>Objects</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Class</h4>
        <p>
            A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects
            are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some points on Python class:
        <ul>
            <li>Classes are created by keyword class.</li>
            <li>Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.</li>
            <li>Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.</li>
            <li>The syntax for creating a class named Addition is :
                <pre><code>class Addition:</code></pre>
                And you can create a method add inside, which returns the sum of two numbers
                <pre><code>class Addition:
    """This is the Addition Class"""

    @staticmethod
    def add(value1, value2):
        """This is the addition method"""
        return value1 + value2</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Objects</h4>
        <p>
            The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object
            like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and
            dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object. The
            number 12 is an object, the string “Hello, world” is an object, a list is an object that can hold other
            objects, and so on. You’ve been using objects all along and may not even realize it.
        </p>
        <p>
            An object consists of :
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>State: </b> It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an
                object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Behavior: </b> It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an
                object to other objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Identity: </b> It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other
                objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To create an object named Add of the class Addition:
        <pre><code>Add = Addition()</code></pre>
        </p>
    </div>
