    <h1>SOLID Principles</h1>
    <p>
        SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin
    </p>
    <p>
        These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and
        extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells,
        refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        SOLID stands for:
    <ul>
        <li><b class="dodgerblue">S:</b> Single-responsiblity Principle</li>
        <li><b class="dodgerblue">O:</b> Open-closed Principle</li>
        <li><b class="dodgerblue">L:</b> Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
        <li><b class="dodgerblue">I:</b> Interface Segregation Principle</li>
        <li><b class="dodgerblue">D:</b> Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h6 class="dodgerblue">Single-responsiblity Principle</h6>
    <p>
        A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
    </p>

    <h6 class="dodgerblue">Open-closed Principle</h6>
    <p>
        Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be
        extendable without modifying the class itself.
    </p>

    <h6 class="dodgerblue">Liskov Substitution Principle</h6>
    <p>
        Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type
        S where S is a subtype of T. This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their
        base or parent class.
    </p>

    <h6 class="dodgerblue">Interface Segregation Principle</h6>
    <p>
        A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to
        depend on methods they do not use.
    </p>

    <h6 class="dodgerblue">Dependency Inversion Principles</h6>
    <p>
        Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend
        on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
    </p>

    <h4>Design Patterns</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Design patterns</b> are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like
        pre-made
        blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or
        libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
        You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known
        problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a
        more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be
        different.
    </p>
    <p>
        An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a
        pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of
        implementation is up to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections
        that are usually present in a pattern description:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Intent</b> of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Motivation</b> further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Structure</b> of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Code example</b> in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the
            pattern.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h6>Why should I learn patterns?</h6>
    <p>
        The truth is that you might manage to work as a programmer for many years without knowing about a single
        pattern. A lot of people do just that. Even in that case, though, you might be implementing some patterns
        without even knowing it. So why would you spend time learning them?

    <ul>
        <li>
            Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if
            you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all
            sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more
            efficiently. You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind
            your suggestion. No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name.
        </li>
    </ul>
